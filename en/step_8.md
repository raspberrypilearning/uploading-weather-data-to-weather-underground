You'll have noticed that currently Weather Underground doesn't have a simple 'air quality' parameter. Could you manipulate the data from your weather station to provide a useful approximation for one of the air quality fields that the site does accept? Weather Underground is always improving the functionality of their site and plans to have a more flexible Air Quality data ingestion capability later in 2017. We'll update this guide when that becomes available so check back here regularly.

Or how about trying some of our other Weather Station resources on [raspberrypi.org](https://raspberrypi.org) to learn how to access the Oracle database and play with data from around the world.
