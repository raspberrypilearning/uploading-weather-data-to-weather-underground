- You'll have noticed that Weather Underground has severa; 'air quality' parameters. Could you manipulate the data from your weather station to provide a useful approximation for one of the air quality fields that the site accepts? Weather Underground is always improving the functionality of their site and plans to have a more flexible air quality data ingestion capability later in 2017. We'll update this guide when that becomes available, so check back here regularly.
