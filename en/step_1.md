## Introduction

There are lots of ways to collect weather data with a Raspberry Pi. For example, you could:

- Collect humidity, temperature, and pressure data with a Sense HAT
- Connect environmental sensors to your GPIO pins and record measurements with some Python code
- Build a complete [Weather Station](https://www.raspberrypi.org/education/weather-station/) similar to the kits we recently sent to lucky schools around the world

Once you're collecting weather measurements, why not share your data with an online community like [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/)?

Weather Underground brings together a global community of people who upload weather and air quality data. This data is displayed on the Weather Underground website, and can be used by other people, for example for forecasting. Many consumer weather stations can be used with Weather Underground, and the code for the Raspberry Pi Oracle school kit can also be modified to stream data in this way.

### What you will make

You'll upload data from your weather sensors to the Weather Underground website, where you will be able to monitor and analyse your measurements.

You can then use the Weather Underground widgets to display a weather summary on your own website.

### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:

+ [Apply programming constructs to solve a problem](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/programming/developer/){:target="_blank"}
+ [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/ddeveloper){:target="_blank"}
