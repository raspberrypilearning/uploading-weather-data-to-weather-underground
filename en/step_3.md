## Registering with Weather Underground

- The first task is to [register with Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/signup). You'll need check the box to confirm that you agree to the Terms of Service and provide an email address. A  message will be sent to that account and you'll need to click on the 'Validate your email'
button that it contains.

- Now login to your new Weather Underground account and add your weather station by selecting that option from the 'More' drop-down in the top menu. The first step is to use the map to set the location of your weather station. Zoom in on the map and try to place the marker as accurately as possible.  You can also set your height above sea level, which you can find using a number of [online tools](https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm).

- On the next page you just need to give a general description of your location. This will appear with your station details on the website so choose something useful. You also need to say what kind of weather station you have: Raspberry Pi is not one of the options so just select 'other'. To finish off the process, click 'submit'.

- Weather Underground will then display a station ID and password. Make a note of these credentials as you'll need them when writing the upload code.
